## Hi! My name is Bruno!

![brunodles's Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=brunodles&theme=nord&show_icons=true&hide_border=true&count_private=true)

I'm a Sr Software Engineer working @ Uber!

I started to code in 2002~2003, after learning about TableTop RPGs. 
Because of that I also started to play eletronic rpgs, at some time I wondered "How does games are made, can I made my own?".

Since then I worked with a lot of things: Java, Java2Me, Delphi 7, Ruby + rails, Android, Kotlin, Docker and a lot more.

For some time went into Developer events, initially as presenter but later I became an organizer of GDG Macei√≥, Android Study Jams, Alagoas Dev, Macei√≥ Coding Dojo. Contributed to the organization of other events like Rails Girls, Docker 1st~3rd Birthday, English Tech Talks and more.

I realy enjoy to experiment new things. I made a lot of changes my carrear: from fullstack to mobile, to devops, to api developer, back to mobile, Eng Manager and then back to mobile again. With every change I learned a little bit, not only about other technologies, but about people and myself. 

I'm Barchelor in SWEngineering and specialized in Mobile development.

* At Home, I'm working on
  * Setting up my HomeLab / HomeServer. I want to experiment new things like [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com/), [CasaOs](https://casaos.zimaspace.com/), [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), [Dokku](https://dokku.com/), [herokuish](https://github.com/gliderlabs/herokuish) and other things
  *  Setting up my new environments, for my HomeLab, my personal machines and for work. See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/brunodles/dotfiles).
* I'm always looking for new things to learn.

My main Repositories are the following:
* [linux-second-screen](https://github.com/brunodles/linux-second-screen) - A collection of bash files to setup virtual display and use it to connect to VNC through Android device
* [PicPicker](https://github.com/brunodles/PicPicker) - An library to act as example of how to capture images from Android Gallery or an camera app
* [i3wm-conf](https://github.com/brunodles/i3wm-conf) - My configuration files for i3wm, this dates back to 2014~15.
* [AndroidSimplePreferences](https://github.com/brunodles/AndroidSimplePreferences) - An exploration on how to mix [Android SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) with [Ruby ActiveRecord](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/active_record_basics.html).
* [SlackUpload](https://github.com/brunodles/SlackUpload) - A gradle plugin that allows to upload artifacts into an slack channel. (We used this as a way to build versions for testing)
* [anime-watcher](https://github.com/brunodles/anime-watcher) - An Android project that can simplify page content and "find" video in certains web pages. With it the user was able to watch animes from some pages as they where in "Crunchyroll" but with the data of other web pages.
