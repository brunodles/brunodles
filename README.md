## Hi! My name is Bruno!

![brunodles's Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=brunodles&theme=nord&show_icons=true&hide_border=true&count_private=true)

I'm a Sr Software Engineer working @ Uber!

I started to code in 2002~2003, after learning about TableTop RPGs. 
Because of that I also started to play eletronic rpgs, at some time I wondered "How does games are made, can I made my own?".

Since then I worked with a lot of things: Java, Java2Me, Delphi 7, Ruby + rails, Android, Kotlin, Docker and a lot more.

For some time went into Developer events, initially as presenter but later I became an organizer of GDG Macei√≥, Android Study Jams, Alagoas Dev, Macei√≥ Coding Dojo. Contributed to the organization of other events like Rails Girls, Docker 1st~3rd Birthday, English Tech Talks and more.

I realy enjoy to experiment new things. I made a lot of changes my carrear: from fullstack to mobile, to devops, to api developer, back to mobile, Eng Manager and then back to mobile again. With every change I learned a little bit, not only about other technologies, but about people and myself. 

I'm Barchelor in SWEngineering and specialized in Mobile development.

* At Home, I'm working on
  * Setting up my HomeLab / HomeServer. I want to experiment new things like [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com/), [CasaOs](https://casaos.zimaspace.com/), [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), [Dokku](https://dokku.com/) and other things
  *  Setting up my new environments, for my HomeLab, my personal machines and for work. See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/brunodles/dotfiles).
* I'm always looking for new things to learn.
